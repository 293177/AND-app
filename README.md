# AND-app
Android project for AND1 in VIA University college

My proposal idea is an app where you could seek for help for plants care. I've had so many plants that I didn't know about and they would die in just a week after a buy them, so an app that helps you take care of the plants would be really useful for me, and I'm sure many others have the same problem. So you could add the plants that you have at home and it will show information about how to take care about the plant, for example how much water does it need every day, does it need to be outside or inside, how much sunlight does it need, etc.

MoSCoW requirements:

• It must have information about all the plants.

• It should have an option to add plants to the database, it should have a tracking system for watering the plants. It should have an easy interactive design.

• It could have a friend system to share plants with each other, and a trivial game about plants.

• It won't have security matters.
